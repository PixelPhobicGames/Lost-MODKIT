Note#1:Before Doing anything compile raylib for your platform then run Make install
Note#2: for some platforms raylib controller inputs dont work like Raspberry Pi etc 
Note#3:Sorry for this chicken scratch code and writting I threw this together really fast. This is a cut down version of the acutal code its a little more effiecient than the acutual code.

How to Compile
	1:Go to the makefiles folder then copy the makefile for you platform in the same directory as this file. This has a Windows makefile by default.
	2:then run make 
	3: Copy the Sprites , Maps , shaders , and Music folder from the acutal game into the root of this folder 
	4:Enjoy 

Trouble shooting:
	The makefiles are just modifyed versions of the raylib template makefiles
	for most platforms other than windows the controller inputs dont work
	I also had DEVKITPRO and raylib on my computer try installing DEVKITPRO for windows.
